# Information

This has gone from just having something for testing to now being used for my live streams on Linux From Scratch.

It really is just easier to copy the install scripts and then download them in the terminal and run them.
So if you see anything pop up with a weird name on a Saturday then it is most likely me losing my brain and crying as something,
that should work isn't in fact working.
